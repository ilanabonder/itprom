#### When is it?
Thursday, March 29th. Doors open at 10 PM.

#### Where is it?
The Basement @ Louie and Chan
303 Broome St, New York, NY 10002

#### Theme
Outer Space. AKA magical adventure through the galaxy, colonization of Mars.

#### What should I wear?
Travel through Space and be the Future... Wear space-suits, cosmic creatures, onesies, video game characters, galaxies, latex, neon colors, glow in the dark, futuristic fabulous, blinky things. Actually, this is the night where you can wear something nice. Shower, brush your hair, wear dry socks... That kinda stuff.

#### Do I need tickets?
Unfortunately, yes. The cost of tickets is to book out the venue exclusively and to serve dinner.

#### How much are they?
Pre-sale tickets are $15 and tickets at the door are $20. So buy them early! Pre-sale tickets end on Tuesday, Marh 27th at 11:59 PM.

#### How do I buy them?
Find Dan or Ilana anytime on the floor! Remember that pre-sale tickets for $15 will on Tuesday March 27th! After that, tickets will increase to $20. Cash or Venmo to @dan-oved. If you're going to use Venmo, you must state "ITProm", your full name, and the number of tickets you are purchasing in the description. If you don't do this, we are just going to take your money to buy ourselves beer.

#### Will there be food?
Absolutely. Although ITProm starts later in the evening/after dinner, we will still feed you.

#### My S.O. is not an ITPer. Can I bring them?
Yes! Non-ITPers are also invited. Friends, parents, relatives, landlords, and/or ex-es are all invited. But they will still need to purchase tickets, either through an ITPer or at the door!

#### How can I go to prom for free?
Enter the [Promposal Contest](/promposal). Duh.
